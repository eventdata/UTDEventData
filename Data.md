To access the real-time and historical event data on our server you need to first get an API key. You can go to this page to [sign up for an API key](https://eventdata.utdallas.edu/signup). Once you fill out the form, an API key will be sent to your email address.

Once you have the API key you can see how to format queries to the eventdata.utdallas.edu server [here](https://github.com/Sayeedsalam/spec-event-data-server).

The default return for the data fields is JSON.

Alternatively, we have built an [interactive site using Two Ravens](http://eventdata.2ravens.org/) to access the data.

In addition, we have an [R package and examples](https://github.com/KateHyoung/UTDEventData) avaiable.  The R package allows you to input your API key and then use some custom functions to return the results in an R dataframe.
