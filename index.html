<p> Infrastructure For Political And Social Event Data using Machine Learning:</p>

<p> The goal of this project is to revolutionize the computerized extraction of conflict event data at a global scale. Currently, most conflict event data are expensively coded by humans from news reports. This project relies on recent advances in artificial intelligence and large language models to address that problem, and builds on earlier NSF efforts that created a publicly-available large language model to study inter- and intra-state conflict, called ConfliBERT (Hu et al., 2022). This project expands ConfliBERT to multilingual settings, including Arabic and Spanish. It is also focused on creating network data for individuals, groups, locations, and events. As this project's cyberinfrastructure develops, a research community is to be fostered through training, education, and outreach with groups at local, national, and international levels, including academia and government. Ultimately, our work can help researchers and policymakers better understand conflict in foreign locations with high accuracy and in real time. </p>

<p> This website also includes data and other information for our past NSF-funded real-time and historical event data API project entitled "Modernizing Political Event Data for Big Data Social Science Research.‚Äù The project led to the creation of event data on political and social events around the globe to better understand the complex dynamics of international relations and civil conflict. The data provide deep spatial and temporal coverages for events that affect regional, national, and international domains, and are drawn from multiple language sources and made freely available within hours of the events occurring. We also provide the software and methodology needed to analyze the data. Please see the Research Papers (insert page link here) page for more information. </p>
